# Dice-Roller
A console app that generates random dice rolls for dice used in tabletop RPGs. 

## Running the Application
1. Download or clone the project.
2. Open in Visual Studio Community (or another environment that can run .Net).
3. Select the DiceRoller assembly as the startup project.
4. Run the project.

## Testing the Application
1. Follow steps 1 and 2 above
2. Open the Test Runner
3. Run All Tests

You may need to restore NuGet Packages for this to run properly. I've had trouble with Unit Testing in cloned/downloaded projects
## Code Examples:
* Unit Testing 
   * Repository Methods
   * Console Testing
* Dependency Injection
* Random class
  * Generating a random number
* Console Mocking
* Queues

*Some code sourced from* [JTux](https://github.com/JTux/InterfacesAndDI) *regarding console mocking*

*See* [MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random?view=netframework-4.7.2) f*or more on Random*

Have fun! :thumbsup:
